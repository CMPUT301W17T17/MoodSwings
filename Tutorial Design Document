## General behaviour
Upon entering any given activity, a default sequence of tooltips will apear in a specific order.
Each one can be interacted with in three ways:
      Dismiss (Or alternatively, "Got it", which may be more fitting of the UI)
      Don't show this again
      [X]
Although the [X] and Dismiss are separate buttons, both accomplish the same purpose:
Closing the popup and moving forward in the tutorial sequence.

"Don't show this again" will be a toggle below the body but above the dismiss button.
